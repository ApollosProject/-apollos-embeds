# apollos-embeds

## COMING SOON!

Apollo React Embeds are ready-made components that can be easily added to
Webflow or other third-party websites. They provide a convenient way to
integrate features such as authentication, a feature feed, and a banner widget.
By using these pre-built components, Apollos clients can save time and effort
utilizing these components, and can ensure a consistent look and feel across all
their digital products.

Upon completion of the MVP development, documentation will be created on how to
use these embeds.
